# Checklist
## 1. Forensic Questions
* Solve the three forensic questions. These may rely on files or programs you will eventually delete, which is why we do them first.
## 2. Configure Update Settings
* Open System Settings and make sure the system checks for and installs updates as much as possible, and make sure the correct software sources are enabled.
## 3. Users
* Add and remove users and change their permissions as dictated by the README. Don't modify passwords just yet.
